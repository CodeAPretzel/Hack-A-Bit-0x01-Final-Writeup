## Challenge ~
Now that we have at least inspected the binary, lets go a bit deeper. You can't just overflow the buffer with a bunch of A's--reverse engineer the software and figure out your payload format. Smash the stack to get the flag, no control necessary yet. Once you have a working exploit, fire it against the remote target to get the real flag.

All challenges in this section use the same binary. The target is x86 and ASLR is on but it shouldn't be relevant to any of your exploits.
