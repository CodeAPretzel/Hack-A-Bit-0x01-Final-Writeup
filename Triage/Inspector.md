## Challenge ~
It's just a simple stream challenge, how hard can it be?

Both challenges for this section use the same pcapng file.

## Solution ~
This challenge had we stumped for a little bit. My initial thought was to go through the TCP and HTTP streams, which only TCP was correct. There were about 500+ packets and I went through each and every one of them until I got the challenge's flag:

What I didn't realize about this challenge was to find specific communication points. For instance, finding `final.hackabit.com` TCP targets would have been a start. Also, in the flag's description, TCP reveals more because of the amount of data they can contain, as was revealed to me by a competitor. This would make it from seeing a HTTP stream like this one:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.hackabit.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123

```
