  # Final Writeup | HackABit-0x01
  âš¡ <b>Summary and Exploitation of the Challenges Provided During the Final Round of HackABit-0x01</b> âš¡
</div>

<br>
<b>INFO ~</b>
<br>
HackABit (HAB), is a CTF competition that competitors try to exploit challenges to receive a flag hidden in a vulnerability. Together, we will go over the challenges I was able to complete as well as how, if possible, these challenges could have been protected to avoid a breach.

  Full Writeups

With this repo, I wasn't able to solve all of the challenges or even do the special event <b>KING OF THE HILL</b> (mainly because it was down, lol). However, HAB got a bunch of writeups that were able to solve all of the challenges, and some were able to document their experience about what they did in KOTH before it shutdown:
